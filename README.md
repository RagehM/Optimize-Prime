## üí° About the Project <a name="about-the-project"></a>

This project features a unique robot capable of seamlessly transitioning between a humanoid form and a vehicle form. Standing 70 cm tall and weighing 3.25 kg, the robot combines entertainment and interactivity with practicality.

The robot is designed to provide a fun and engaging user experience, recognizing faces, waving hello, and responding to voice commands like ‚ÄúTransform‚Äù using TinyML technology. Entirely wireless, it can be controlled through a web interface hosted on a Pico W, making it adaptable to various environments and perfect for delivering entertainment with a practical twist.

## üöß Currently Working On <a name="currently-working-on"></a>

- **Enable I2C on a read req from the master.**
- **Solving the RUN TIME ERROR after waving.**
- **Migrating to FreeRTOS.**
- **Conduct more trials and adjust mechanisms or control algorithms for better fluidity in transformations.**
- **Neural Network Classifier**
  - Expand the dataset to improve the NN classifier‚Äôs reliability.
  - Optimize and tweak it in a real-world environment for robustness.
- **Facial Recognition System**
  - Further fine-tune to ensure consistent performance under varying conditions.
    Next Steps
  - Schedule systematic testing of each functionality under real-world conditions.
  - Monitor performance to identify weak spots and refine both hardware and software aspects
